# Alzheimer-app


The idea behind this project was to develop a system that can help doctors and patients' families track the progression of Alzheimer's disease and monitor the effectiveness of treatments. The system uses an application form that can be filled out daily with information about the patient's behavior, symptmos and medication. This information is saved in a database and used to generate statistics that doctors and families could use to make informed decisions about the patient's care. By tracking the progression of the disease and the effectiveness of treatments, this system could potentially help improve the quality of life for patients with Alzheimer's disease.

Webapplication presented in December 2022, for the Final Project for the Higher Diploma in Science in Computing at the National College of Ireland.


Technologies Used: Java, Maven, mySQL, SpringBoot, SpringMVC, Thymeleaf, Bootstrap, SpringSecurity, REST Api, JavaScript and Chart.js.
