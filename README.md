# Alzheimer-app
<h4><i>Webapplication presented in December 2022, for the Final Project for the Higher Diploma in Science in Computing at the National College of Ireland.</i></h3>


The idea behind this project was to develop a helpful tool for managing Alzheimer's disease. The use of a daily application form to track symptoms and medication can provide valuable information to both doctors and patients' families, and the ability to generate statistics from the data collected can help them make informed decisions about the patient's care.

Alzheimer's disease is a progressive, degenerative disorder that affects the brain and can cause a wide range of symptoms, including memory loss, confusion, and difficulty with communication and decision-making. It is a challenging condition to manage, and finding effective treatments can be difficult. By tracking the progression of the disease and the effectiveness of treatments, this system could potentially help improve the quality of life for patients with Alzheimer's disease.

The development of this project as a final project for a Higher Diploma in Science in Computing shows the potential for technology to play a role in managing and treating diseases like Alzheimer's. By using technology to track and analyze data, doctors and patients' families can gain valuable insights into the progression of the disease and the effectiveness of treatments, which can help them make more informed decisions about the patient's care. Overall, this project represents an interesting and potentially helpful approach to managing Alzheimer's disease.
